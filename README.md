# calculator

 an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
 
four operations:
add
subtract
multiply
divide

Users can string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = yields 42.

has a backspace button, a decimal button for floating numbers and displays a message when dividing by 0. design inspired by TI 108 calculator.

trying to fix bug with number displaying.

if you enter a number then an operator and another number that calculation should be displayed if your next input is an operator, is not functional currently. must enter same operator twice for it to continue.
